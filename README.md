```rust

extern crate serde_json;

use eventstore::{ Connection, EventData };
use futures::Future;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:1113".parse()?;
    let connection = Connection::builder()
        .single_node_connection(addr)
        .await;

    // It is not mandatory to use JSON as a data format however GetEventStore
    // provides great additional value if you do so.
    let payload = json!({
        "is_rust_a_nice_language": true,
    });

    let event = EventData::json("language-poll", payload)?;

    let result = connection
        .write_events("language-stream")
        .push_event(event)
        .execute()
        .await?;

    // Do something productive with the result.
    println!("{:?}", result);

    Ok(())
}
```
